# Project loops

## Sync Health Loop

Saved 2026-08-09. One-sentence explanation: after each scheduled sync, the loop
observes sync/reconcile/alert health and either fixes the smallest actionable
failure or stops when the pipeline is clean, keeping inventory-count writes
human-approved.

Prompt:
> After each scheduled sync, read SyncRun failures, reconcile drift, and open
> StockAlerts. Pick the single highest-cost actionable failure, trace it to its
> root cause using only in-scope code and logs, and apply the smallest reversible
> fix (config, scoped data repair, or code change). Re-run the sync and check the
> same metric improved. Stop when no sync has failed in the last two runs and
> actionable drift is zero; if the failure is a credential or external outage,
> escalate with evidence instead of retrying.

### Change log

- 2026-08-09 (debrief, run 1): added baseline guidance — treat failures
  *after the last successful sync* as the working signal, and ignore
  historical failures (already-triaged rows accumulate and never clear on
  their own). This stops the loop from re-auditing the same old failures every
  run. When a fix resolves a failure class, record it here so the next run
  skips that class.

- 2026-08-09 (debrief, run 1): resolved failure classes —
  - `PG::UniqueViolation customers_pkey` → debug customer rows from Phase A;
    sequence is far ahead of max id, no recurrence expected.
  - `undefined method 'order_attrs'` → fixed in Phase A importer refactor.
  - Pre-Postgres `SQLite3`/`SkuLink` errors → historical, pre-migration.
  - One-time `GraphQL 401` → transient token; no recurrence in the last 3 runs.

## Maintainability Audit Loop

Saved 2026-08-13. One-sentence explanation: on request, reads the whole repo as
a Rails expert for maintainability — structure, duplication, conventions,
complexity, updatability — and returns evidence-cited, ranked findings without
changing code.

Prompt:
> Read the repo (web/ plus legacy/ reference) read-only as a Rails expert.
> Assess how the code is broken up: structure/layering, duplicated or drifted
> patterns, convention consistency, complexity hotspots, N+1s, dead code, and
> how hard it is to update safely. For every claim cite file:line; show at
> least two occurrences before calling something repeated. Deliver findings
> ranked by impact/effort with a recommended order of attack. Do not modify
> code or the database; stop when the scoped surface is reviewed. Ask before
> any destructive, irreversible, or production change.

### Change log

- 2026-08-13 (run 1): baseline findings — retire legacy/ second sync engine;
  snake_case the 19 camelCase tables; single SquareInventoryWriter +
  InventoryMovement.journal!; split Settings/Reports controllers; fix the
  size-families collection approve_all 404; kill three N+1 hotspots; test
  bootstrap helper.
