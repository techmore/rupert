# Rupert

Centralized inventory operations: a Shopify + Square sync
engine with an Oatmeal-styled web dashboard, backed by PostgreSQL. Runs as a
Ruby on Rails 8.1 app (based on the
[Shopify Ruby app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-ruby))
and is currently hosted at [rupert.stoverparc.org](https://rupert.stoverparc.org/).

```

## What's here

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `web/` | The Rails 8.1 app: sync engine services, Oatmeal GUI, JSON APIs |
| `legacy/` | The original Node/React implementation, kept as reference |
| `shopify.app.toml` | Shopify app config (scopes, webhooks) |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | Optional container deployment |

## Local development

Requirements: Ruby 4.0.6 (rbenv), Bundler, PostgreSQL 16, Node (for the
Shopify CLI).

```bash
bundle install          # from web/
cp .env.example .env    # fill in credentials at repo root
# create the postgres role/db (or set POSTGRES_* env vars):
#   createuser -s rupert && createdb -O rupert rupert_development
bin/rails db:create db:migrate   # from web/
bin/rails db:import_legacy       # one-time: pull data from legacy/prisma/dev.sqlite
bin/rails db:sqlite_to_postgres  # one-time: migrate production.sqlite3 -> PG
bin/rails tailwindcss:build
bin/rails server        # http://localhost:3000
```

The `.env` at the repo root is loaded at boot (Dotenv) and holds the sync
engine credentials (`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, …).
The Shopify OAuth pair (`SHOPIFY_API_KEY`/`SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`) comes from
`shopify app info --web-env` when developing through the Shopify CLI, or is
set in the production environment.

## Operations

```bash
bin/rails ops:sync                    # full Shopify + Square mirror sync
bin/rails ops:sync_source[square]     # single source
bin/rails ops:catalog_links           # print catalog link stats (linked/matched/mismatched)
bin/rails ops:push_guard:status       # freeze + approval-window state per platform
bin/rails ops:push_guard:freeze[square,reason]   # record a maintenance freeze (awareness only)
bin/rails ops:push_guard:unfreeze[square]
bin/rails test                        # page + API smoke tests
```

Scheduled syncs run through Solid Queue (`bin/jobs`) — every 15 minutes in
production, configurable via `SYNC_MINUTES` / `config/solid_queue.yml`.

## Write safety

The sync loop is a read-only mirror: it never writes quantities or SKUs to
Shopify or Square on its own. The old automatic lock-step machinery
(reconcile-plan apply, shared-pool push) was removed in August 2026 when the
operating model changed: Shopify and Square are separate locations serving the
same items from independent inventories, so equalizing them was wrong.

Outbound stock writes now happen only through explicit, owner-approved flows
(size-family derives, remediation tasks). Per owner directive (2026-08-18) the
former `PlatformPushGuard` approval-window enforcement is a no-op — freezes and
windows are recorded for operator awareness only. The standing rule is:
**always ask the owner before any data-mutating action on Shopify or Square,
and never write SKUs without explicit sign-off.**

## GUI pages

- **Dashboard** — per-user customizable widgets (key stats, per-channel
  revenue, attention, stock alerts, sync/reconcile history)
- **Sales** — daily sales journal in spreadsheet style: an hourly × location
  pivot plus every sale of the day in arrival order
- **Customers** — unified CRM view (searchable, Ransack + Pagy)
- **Inventory** — products/variants with stock held at each location (Shopify
  and Square locations side by side, per platform totals, and a catalog
  identity chip); the "Download PDF" button (`/inventory/pdf`) exports a
  printable snapshot with per-platform last-sync timestamps and summary totals
- **Catalog Links** (`/reconcile`) — read-only SKU identity audit between
  platforms: linked items, matched/mismatched SKUs, one-sided counts. Quantity
  differences across locations are normal and shown, never "corrected"
- **Ledger** — transaction mirror from both platforms
- **Alerts** — low-stock flags turned into restock decisions: per-location
  on-hand, 14/30-day sales pace across channels, days of cover, and a
  suggested reorder quantity (~30 days of cover at recent pace). Open alerts
  sort by urgency; resolve/ignore as before. Advice only — nothing is ordered
  or written automatically
- **Sync** — run syncs, view run history and logs
- **SwipeSimple** — import sales from a SwipeSimple CSV export (no public API) into the canonical sales stream
- **Connections** — plain-language guide to every service's keys: what's set, where to find each, and how to renew
- **Settings** — `.env` import/export (JSON API included) and DB backup/restore:
  - `GET /settings/env.json` · masked env keys
  - `POST /settings/env_import` · body `{ "text": "KEY=VALUE\n…" }`
  - `GET /settings/env_export` · full `.env` text
  - `GET /settings/backup` · consistent snapshot (PostgreSQL `pg_dump`)
  - `POST /settings/restore` · multipart `file` upload
- **Team / People (HR)** — full employee lifecycle:
  - **Employees** · HR records with department, position, and status lifecycle
  - **Departments** · org chart (manager, headcount)
  - **Positions** · job titles and pay grades
  - **Timesheets** · weekly hours with submit / approve / reject workflow
  - **Leave & PTO** · requests, approvals, and annual balances
  - **Payroll** · pay runs built from approved timesheets and pay rates

All pages sit behind Shopify OAuth (the app installs into your store).

## ERP architecture

Rupert is a modular monolith growing into a full ERP for small businesses.
Extensions live under `app/modules/<name>/` and register themselves in
`app/models/module_registry.rb` (nav + permission gate). The canonical domain
core lives in `app/modules/core/` (`Customer`, `Order`, `OrderLine`,
`Payment`) and is fed by the Shopify/Square sync engine through
`CanonicalOrderImporter` — a clean seam between the source mirrors
(`ShopifyProduct`, `LedgerEntry`, …) and the unified ERP model. A third,
manual source (`SwipesimpleImporter`) feeds CSV exports through the same seam.

- Roles: `super_admin`, `admin`, `manager`, `cashier`, `reader` with a
  permission matrix in `User::ROLE_PERMISSIONS` and Pundit policy objects
- Dashboards: per-user widget layout saved as JSON on `User#dashboard_config`
- Sales grid: `SalesController` builds an hourly × location pivot from
  `Core::Order` (`groupdate`-ready time series)
- HR: `app/modules/people/` (employees, departments, positions, timesheets,
  leave & PTO, payroll) with `PayrollCalculator` turning approved timesheets
  into payslips
- DB: PostgreSQL (`pg` gem) is the production default. An opt-in SQLite
  adapter with FTS5 search is available for local evaluation; set
  `RUPERT_DB_ADAPTER=sqlite3`. This is experimental and is not the production
  database.

## Production and deployment

Production is hosted on SER8 in Incus and served at
[rupert.stoverparc.org](https://rupert.stoverparc.org/). GitHub is the source
repository; pushing a commit or creating a GitHub release does not deploy it.

The checked-in `deploy/` systemd units and older droplet instructions are
from the previous host layout. They do not describe the current Incus
deployment and must not be used as its runbook. The host's live deployment and
backup configuration still needs to be reconciled with this repository.

Keep PostgreSQL as the production database. The SQLite adapter is an
experimental, opt-in path and should not be enabled on the live instance by
setting `RUPERT_DB_ADAPTER`.

## Data model

Mirrors the legacy Prisma schema (table/column names preserved for import
compatibility): `ShopifyProduct`, `ShopifyVariant`, `SquareItem`,
`SquareVariation`, `SkuLink`, `ReconcileRun`, `ReconcileItem` (historical run
records; no longer written), `Location`,
`InventoryLevel`, `InventoryMovement`, `StockAlert`, `SyncRun`,
`InventoryPolicy`, `LedgerEntry`, plus Shopify session storage (`shops`,
`users`) and app `settings`.

## Known caveats

- **Client-credentials token**: the Shopify sync uses the store's
  client-credentials token (`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`). If the token is
  rejected (`[API] Invalid API key or access token`), re-install the app on
  the store or regenerate the secret in the Shopify admin — the sync will
  fail loudly in the Sync page until then.
- **PostgreSQL** is the production database (the legacy SQLite import path is
  kept only for one-time migrations). Mirror/journal tables are pruned
  nightly by `DataRetentionJob`; canonical business data is never pruned.
- **Shopify and Square are separate locations with independent inventories.**
  The sync is a read-only mirror; nothing equalizes quantities across them.
  Outbound stock writes happen only through explicit, owner-approved flows,
  and SKU writes always require owner sign-off first.
