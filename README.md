# Rupert

Centralized inventory operations: a Shopify + Square sync
engine with an Oatmeal-styled web dashboard, backed by a single SQLite
database. Runs as a Ruby on Rails 7.1 app (based on the
[Shopify Ruby app template](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-app-template-ruby))
and deploys to a DigitalOcean droplet (manually — GitHub is a code repo only).

```

## What's here

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `web/` | The Rails 7.1 app: sync engine services, Oatmeal GUI, JSON APIs |
| `legacy/` | The original Node/React implementation, kept as reference |
| `shopify.app.toml` | Shopify app config (scopes, webhooks) |
| `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml` | Droplet deployment (fallback, unused) |

## Local development

Requirements: Ruby 4.0.6 (rbenv), Bundler, PostgreSQL 16, Node (for the
Shopify CLI).

```bash
bundle install          # from web/
cp .env.example .env    # fill in credentials at repo root
# create the postgres role/db (or set POSTGRES_* env vars):
#   createuser -s rupert && createdb -O rupert rupert_development
bin/rails db:create db:migrate   # from web/
bin/rails db:import_legacy       # one-time: pull data from legacy/prisma/dev.sqlite
bin/rails db:sqlite_to_postgres  # one-time: migrate production.sqlite3 -> PG
bin/rails tailwindcss:build
bin/rails server        # http://localhost:3000
```

The `.env` at the repo root is loaded at boot (Dotenv) and holds the sync
engine credentials (`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID/SECRET`, `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN`, …).
The Shopify OAuth pair (`SHOPIFY_API_KEY`/`SHOPIFY_API_SECRET`) comes from
`shopify app info --web-env` when developing through the Shopify CLI, or is
set on the droplet for production.

## Operations

```bash
bin/rails ops:sync                    # full Shopify + Square mirror sync
bin/rails ops:sync_source[square]     # single source
bin/rails ops:catalog_links           # print catalog link stats (linked/matched/mismatched)
bin/rails ops:push_guard:status       # freeze + approval-window state per platform
bin/rails ops:push_guard:freeze[square,reason]   # record a maintenance freeze (awareness only)
bin/rails ops:push_guard:unfreeze[square]
bin/rails test                        # page + API smoke tests
```

Scheduled syncs run through Solid Queue (`bin/jobs`) — every 15 minutes in
production, configurable via `SYNC_MINUTES` / `config/solid_queue.yml`.

## Write safety

The sync loop is a read-only mirror: it never writes quantities or SKUs to
Shopify or Square on its own. The old automatic lock-step machinery
(reconcile-plan apply, shared-pool push) was removed in August 2026 when the
operating model changed: Shopify and Square are separate locations serving the
same items from independent inventories, so equalizing them was wrong.

Outbound stock writes now happen only through explicit, owner-approved flows
(size-family derives, remediation tasks). Per owner directive (2026-08-18) the
former `PlatformPushGuard` approval-window enforcement is a no-op — freezes and
windows are recorded for operator awareness only. The standing rule is:
**always ask the owner before any data-mutating action on Shopify or Square,
and never write SKUs without explicit sign-off.**

## GUI pages

- **Dashboard** — per-user customizable widgets (key stats, per-channel
  revenue, attention, stock alerts, sync/reconcile history)
- **Sales** — daily sales journal in spreadsheet style: an hourly × location
  pivot plus every sale of the day in arrival order
- **Customers** — unified CRM view (searchable, Ransack + Pagy)
- **Inventory** — products/variants with stock held at each location (Shopify
  and Square locations side by side, per platform totals, and a catalog
  identity chip); the "Download PDF" button (`/inventory/pdf`) exports a
  printable snapshot with per-platform last-sync timestamps and summary totals
- **Catalog Links** (`/reconcile`) — read-only SKU identity audit between
  platforms: linked items, matched/mismatched SKUs, one-sided counts. Quantity
  differences across locations are normal and shown, never "corrected"
- **Ledger** — transaction mirror from both platforms
- **Alerts** — low-stock flags turned into restock decisions: per-location
  on-hand, 14/30-day sales pace across channels, days of cover, and a
  suggested reorder quantity (~30 days of cover at recent pace). Open alerts
  sort by urgency; resolve/ignore as before. Advice only — nothing is ordered
  or written automatically
- **Sync** — run syncs, view run history and logs
- **SwipeSimple** — import sales from a SwipeSimple CSV export (no public API) into the canonical sales stream
- **Connections** — plain-language guide to every service's keys: what's set, where to find each, and how to renew
- **Settings** — `.env` import/export (JSON API included) and DB backup/restore:
  - `GET /settings/env.json` · masked env keys
  - `POST /settings/env_import` · body `{ "text": "KEY=VALUE\n…" }`
  - `GET /settings/env_export` · full `.env` text
  - `GET /settings/backup` · consistent snapshot (PostgreSQL `pg_dump`)
  - `POST /settings/restore` · multipart `file` upload
- **Team / People (HR)** — full employee lifecycle:
  - **Employees** · HR records with department, position, and status lifecycle
  - **Departments** · org chart (manager, headcount)
  - **Positions** · job titles and pay grades
  - **Timesheets** · weekly hours with submit / approve / reject workflow
  - **Leave & PTO** · requests, approvals, and annual balances
  - **Payroll** · pay runs built from approved timesheets and pay rates

All pages sit behind Shopify OAuth (the app installs into your store).

## ERP architecture

Rupert is a modular monolith growing into a full ERP for small businesses.
Extensions live under `app/modules/<name>/` and register themselves in
`app/models/module_registry.rb` (nav + permission gate). The canonical domain
core lives in `app/modules/core/` (`Customer`, `Order`, `OrderLine`,
`Payment`) and is fed by the Shopify/Square sync engine through
`CanonicalOrderImporter` — a clean seam between the source mirrors
(`ShopifyProduct`, `LedgerEntry`, …) and the unified ERP model. A third,
manual source (`SwipesimpleImporter`) feeds CSV exports through the same seam.

- Roles: `super_admin`, `admin`, `manager`, `cashier`, `reader` with a
  permission matrix in `User::ROLE_PERMISSIONS` and Pundit policy objects
- Dashboards: per-user widget layout saved as JSON on `User#dashboard_config`
- Sales grid: `SalesController` builds an hourly × location pivot from
  `Core::Order` (`groupdate`-ready time series)
- HR: `app/modules/people/` (employees, departments, positions, timesheets,
  leave & PTO, payroll) with `PayrollCalculator` turning approved timesheets
  into payslips
- DB: PostgreSQL (`pg` gem). SQLite is kept only for the one-time legacy import.

## Deploying to a droplet

GitHub is used only as the code repository — there is **no automated deploy
from GitHub to the droplet**. Deploys are manual: commit and push to `main`,
then SSH to the droplet and pull + restart.

The deploy path is git-pull + systemd (the Docker files are a fallback/
alternative and are not used for deployment).

1. Provision a droplet (Ubuntu) with Ruby 4.0 (rbenv), PostgreSQL, and systemd.
2. On the droplet, clone the repo and create `/root/rupert/.env` (copy from
   `.env.example`):
   - `SHOPIFY_API_KEY` / `SHOPIFY_API_SECRET` / `HOST` (public HTTPS URL)
   - `SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN` (+ optional `SQUARE_LOCATION_ID`)
   - `SECRET_KEY_BASE` (`bin/rails secret`)
   - `RAILS_ENCRYPTION_PRIMARY_KEY` / `DETERMINISTIC_KEY` / `KEY_DERIVATION_SALT`
     (`bin/rails db:encryption:init`) — keep these stable, encrypted
     settings will be unreadable if they change
   - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` — a real, random password. The app **refuses to boot
     in production** without it (no "rupert" default), and the same value must
     match the local PostgreSQL role.
3. Install the versioned systemd units from `deploy/`:
   `rupert-web.service`, `rupert-jobs.service`, and the nightly
   `rupert-backup.timer`/`rupert-backup.service`.
4. Deploy a release by SSHing to the droplet and running:
   ```bash
   cd /root/rupert && git pull --ff-only origin main && chown -R rupert:rupert web
   cd web && bundle install --quiet
   bin/rails tailwindcss:build
   RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails assets:precompile
   RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails db:migrate
   systemctl restart rupert-web rupert-jobs
   ```
   Nightly backups land in `/var/backups/rupert` (DB dump + encrypted
   `settings` dump + `.env`); also keep the Google Drive backup enabled as an
   off-box copy.

## Data model

Mirrors the legacy Prisma schema (table/column names preserved for import
compatibility): `ShopifyProduct`, `ShopifyVariant`, `SquareItem`,
`SquareVariation`, `SkuLink`, `ReconcileRun`, `ReconcileItem` (historical run
records; no longer written), `Location`,
`InventoryLevel`, `InventoryMovement`, `StockAlert`, `SyncRun`,
`InventoryPolicy`, `LedgerEntry`, plus Shopify session storage (`shops`,
`users`) and app `settings`.

## Known caveats

- **Client-credentials token**: the Shopify sync uses the store's
  client-credentials token (`SHOPIFY_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`). If the token is
  rejected (`[API] Invalid API key or access token`), re-install the app on
  the store or regenerate the secret in the Shopify admin — the sync will
  fail loudly in the Sync page until then.
- **PostgreSQL** is the production database (the legacy SQLite import path is
  kept only for one-time migrations). Mirror/journal tables are pruned
  nightly by `DataRetentionJob`; canonical business data is never pruned.
- **Shopify and Square are separate locations with independent inventories.**
  The sync is a read-only mirror; nothing equalizes quantities across them.
  Outbound stock writes happen only through explicit, owner-approved flows,
  and SKU writes always require owner sign-off first.
