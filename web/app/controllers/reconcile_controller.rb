# Catalog Links (formerly "Reconcile"): the SKU-level identity audit between
# Shopify variants and Square variations. Read-only by design — Shopify and
# Square are separate locations with independent inventories, so there is no
# quantity plan to apply here. Stock writes happen only through explicit,
# owner-approved flows elsewhere.
